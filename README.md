# Navitate

Navitate (portmanteau of “navigate” and “annotate”) is an Android application that allows users to mark up and save maps. I would describe this app as a functional prototype — I mainly put it together to showcase some of the skills I developed during my fourth year software engineering course, including native Android development, Maps API, and backend development with JavaScript. The app’s frontend communicates with a node.js server using a REST client called Retrofit.

As for functionality, users can open up an instance of Google Maps, navigate to any point, and annotate the map with circles, lines, or freehand drawings. Users can then save this map to the server and subsequently retrieve it to view or edit. One can also browse maps from other users that have been posted to the server.
